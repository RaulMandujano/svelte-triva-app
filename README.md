# Svelte - Cybernetically enhanced web apps
For this assignment, we will be exploring the Svelte Framework by building a simple trivia app.

## Trivia App Assignment - User Stories
* As a user, I want to be asked trivia questions
* As a user, I want to be able to answer trivia questions
* As a user, I want to know how many questions I have answered correctly or wrong.
* As a user, I want to be able to select a difficulty level.
* As a user I want to be able to select a category for the game.
* App must be hosted at a live URL

When you are done, turn in the URL to your live app and a link to your Github classroom repo.

## General requirements:
The app must be well designed and user friendly. The point of this class isn't to focus on the design, but if the user experience needs to be thought about when writing applications.

## Tips and Resources
* The [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) is a very good resource. You don't have to use this, and there are other APIs out there.
* This [video](https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao) is a great place to lern about Svelte and the motivations behind it.
* The [Svelte Homepage](https://svelte.dev) is where all the excellent docs are.
